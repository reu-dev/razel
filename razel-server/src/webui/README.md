# webui

This webui uses the [Leptos](https://github.com/leptos-rs/leptos) web framework and the [cargo-leptos](https://github.com/akesson/cargo-leptos) tool using [Axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum).

## Running

```bash
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
cargo install cargo-leptos --locked
cargo leptos watch
```

## Executing a Server on a Remote Machine Without the Toolchain
After running a `cargo leptos build --release` the minimum files needed are:

1. The server binary located in `target/server/release`
2. The `site` directory and all files within located in `target/site`

Copy these files to your remote server. The directory structure should be:
```text
webui
site/
```
Set the following environment variables (updating for your project as needed):
```sh
export LEPTOS_OUTPUT_NAME="webui"
export LEPTOS_SITE_ROOT="site"
export LEPTOS_SITE_PKG_DIR="pkg"
export LEPTOS_SITE_ADDR="127.0.0.1:3000"
export LEPTOS_RELOAD_PORT="3001"
```
Finally, run the server binary.
