# razel cache

command execution with cache:

1. if action is not completely cached: execute action and push to cache
2. symlink output files from local cache to `out_dir`

read cache for `Action`:

1. create `ActionDigest` on `Action` serialized to pb
2. get `ActionResult` from local ac cache (read pb file)
    * if exists and all `ActionResult::output_files` exist in local cas cache => cache hit
3. request `ActionResult` from remote ac cache
    * if received, query missing blobs from `ActionResult::output_files`
    * store `ActionResult` and received blobs in local cache
