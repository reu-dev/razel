A command executor with caching. It is:

* Fast: caching avoids repeated execution of commands which haven't changed
* Reliable: commands are executed in a sandbox to detect missing dependencies
* Easy to use: commands are specified using a high-level TypeScript or Python API and convenience functions/tasks are
  built-in
* Made for: data processing pipelines with executables working on files and many dependencies between those

Razel is not the best choice for building software, especially there's no built-in support for compiler setup and header
dependencies.

## Getting Started

Use [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) to install Rust. Install `protobuf-compiler`. Clone and build Razel:

```bash
cargo install razel
```

The native input format for Razel is a `razel.jsonl` file, see the example [test/razel.jsonl](test/razel.jsonl).
```
razel exec -f test/razel.jsonl
```

The preferred way to create a `razel.jsonl` file is using one of the high-level APIs.

### TypeScript API

Install [Deno](https://deno.land/) to use the [TypeScript API](include/deno/razel.ts).
Run the [example Deno script](test/deno.ts) to create `test/razel.jsonl` and execute it with Razel:

```bash
deno run --allow-write=. --check test/deno.ts
razel exec -f test/razel.jsonl
```

### Python API

The [Python API](include/python/razel.py) requires Python >= 3.8.
Run the [example Python script](test/python.py) to create `test/razel.jsonl` and execute it with Razel:

```bash
pip install razel
python3 test/python.py
razel exec -f test/razel.jsonl
```

### Batch file

In addition to `razel.jsonl`, Razel can directly execute a batch file containing commands.
Input and output files need to be specified, which is WIP.

Execute the example [test/batch.sh](test/batch.sh) with Razel:

```bash
razel exec -f test/batch.sh
```

## Project Status

Razel is in active development and **not** ready for production. CLI and format of `razel.jsonl` will likely change.

## Why not ...?

* [Bazel](https://bazel.build/) is a multi-language build tool. However, for the use case Razel targets, there are some
  issues:
    * additional launcher script required for some simple tasks
        * using stdout of action as input for another action
        * parsing measurements from stdout of action
        * CTest features like FAIL_REGULAR_EXPRESSION, WILL_FAIL
    * difficult to get command lines for debugging
    * no automatic disk usage limit/cleanup for local cache - all temp output needs to fit on disk
    * no native support for response files
    * resources cannot be reserved to run real-time critical tests
    * content of bazel-bin/out directories is not defined (contains mixture of current build and cache)
* [CTest](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html) is nice for building C/C++ code and CTest can be used
  for testing,
  but it does not support caching and managing dependencies between tests is difficult.

## Features

### Measurements

Razel parses the stdout of executed commands to capture runtime measurements and writes them to `razel-out/measurements.csv`.
Currently, the `<CTestMeasurement>` and `<DartMeasurement>` tags as used by [CTest/CDash](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/ctest_test.html#additional-test-measurements) are supported:
```
<CTestMeasurement type="numeric/double" name="score">12.3</CTestMeasurement>
<CTestMeasurement type="text/string" name="result">ok</CTestMeasurement>
```
Supporting custom formats is planned.

### Param/Response files

Commands with huge number of arguments might result in command lines which are too long to be executed by the OS.
Razel detects those cases and replaces the arguments with a response file. The filename starts with @.

## Acknowledgements

The idea to build fast and correct is based on [Bazel](https://bazel.build/). Razel uses data structures from
the [Bazel Remote Execution API](https://github.com/bazelbuild/remote-apis/blob/main/build/bazel/remote/execution/v2/remote_execution.proto)
for caching.
